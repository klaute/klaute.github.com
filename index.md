## About

With over 20 years of experience in embedded and platform development, I specialize in Security Architecture, Security-by-Design, and the transformation of engineering organizations towards secure development practices.

My work focuses on:

- Designing secure platform architectures  
- Enabling teams to implement security effectively  
- Integrating regulatory requirements into technical systems  
- Supporting management decisions with technical depth  

I operate at the intersection of architecture, engineering methodology, and organizational enablement — not as an implementer, but as a technical authority guiding secure system development.
