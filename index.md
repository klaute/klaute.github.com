## About

With over 20 years of experience in embedded and platform development, I focus on Security Architecture, Security-by-Design and organizational enablement in complex engineering environments.

My work focuses on:

- Designing secure platform architectures
- Enabling teams to implement security effectively
- Integrating regulatory requirements into technical systems
- Supporting management decisions with technical depth

I operate at the intersection of architecture, engineering methodology, and organizational enablement — not as an implementer, but as a technical authority guiding secure system development.

This includes leading cross-project architectural alignment and coordinating security decisions across globally distributed engineering teams in Europe, Asia, and North America.
